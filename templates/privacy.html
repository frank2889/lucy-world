    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Lucy World is built for privacy-first marketers. We minimise the data we collect, store every record securely, and never sell, rent, or trade any personal information.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account details:</strong> email address and display name so we can authenticate you and deliver product updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Query telemetry:</strong> anonymised keyword searches, language, market, provider counts, and aggregate scoring. We store no IP addresses, user agents, or unique identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>AI drafting artefacts:</strong> generated outlines, markdown, and published blog posts tied to keyword candidates. These contain no personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> messages you send to our team so we can resolve issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the growth flywheel uses data</h2>
    <p>The AI blog pipeline operates entirely on aggregated keyword signals. We log the minimum viable metadata—keyword text, language, country, provider counts, and audience score—to decide if a query should advance through the flywheel. Drafts and published posts reuse the stored keyword and high-level performance context only.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No personal data or customer content is sent to language models.</li>
      <li>All prompts redact emails, names, and freeform inputs before processing.</li>
      <li>Published content lives on Lucy World infrastructure and carries no tracking pixels or cross-site scripts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies & tracking</h2>
    <p>We only use strictly necessary cookies for authentication. There are no marketing cookies, third-party analytics scripts, or fingerprinting techniques.</p>

    <h2>Data residency & retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary data centres reside in the EU. Backups are encrypted and stored within the same region.</li>
      <li>Query telemetry rolls off after 180 days unless it feeds an active growth experiment.</li>
      <li>Published blog content remains online until manually archived. Removing a post deletes the markdown, HTML, and manifest entries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access, correct, or delete your account data at any time.</li>
      <li>Request a machine-readable export of your projects and query history.</li>
      <li>Contact us to suppress future processing—your information will be permanently removed from active systems within 30 days.</li>
    </ul>
