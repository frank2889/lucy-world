## CRO notes (OctÂ 2025)

- Dutch visitors default to this locale (`/nl/`) with market `NL` for the first search; keep copy polished.
- Ensure CTA translations stay aligned with CRO naming (`Upgrade`, `Koop AI-credits`, `Probeer Premium 7 dagen gratis`).
- QA the Premium overlay, `/pricing`, and `/billing/credits` templates here first before propagating to other locales.
